# Tile Wars - Rules & Guide

## Game Overview
- The battlefield is a 50×50 grid divided among 4 teams, each starting in a corner with its own color.
- Your team color is automatically assigned based on your browser cookies and stays the same each time you return.
  
## How to Play
1. Start in your team's corner with a small patch of your color.
2. Expand your territory by placing tiles:
   - Tiles must connect horizontally or vertically to your existing tiles.
3. Earn new tiles by completing mini challenges.
   - Each cooldown cycle allows you to place the tiles you’ve earned.
4. Defend your team and block other teams from expanding.
5. Eliminate teams by cutting off their tiles completely.
   - Eliminated teams can return via sabotages, performing disruptive actions to cut back into the game.
   - 
## Tile Placement & Cooldowns
- After completing a challenge, your tiles recharge.
- Cooldowns limit how often you can place tiles.
